TODO:
1. Add "Your Account" to the overflow.
2. Add a back button.
3. # of ratings - a global variable.
4. What to do about semester:
	Should we only do Spring 2014 - or also Winter 2013?  
	Or one or the other depending on whether it met that semester?
5. About page?

Small fixes:
Login screen back to ScrollView.
Fix log in button.
Set up CourseView/ProfessorView existing ratings.


Raphi's questions:
Rename app - maybe TechnionRater?  Our app currently does not rank teachers - it rates them.
Maybe add loading page?

Leo - Raphi discussed:

Every professor in the UG system you can search for.
You can rate anyone - but limit 10 ratings per semester.

Raphi - Sam discussed:
Rename app to RateMyTechnion

Include screenshots of parsed pages in our poster?

Big tasks:
1. Database
2. Menu bar
3. Previous ratings
